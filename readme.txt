A fast ajax shortcode that outputs the latest items out of an RSS feed of your choice.

== Description ==

RSS Feed Shortcode is a plugin that enables you to display the content of RSS feeds in tables within your Posts and Pages via a fast ajax shortcode.

= How to Use =

Type the following into your Post or Page content, replacing the example link with the link to your desired RSS feed.

`[rss feed="https://wordpress.org/news/feed/"]`

The output of the shortcode is a table of the latest items from the feed. Each item includes the date, title and link.

The feeds are loaded with ajax, which means you can load up your Post or Page with as many feeds as you like without slowing your page load speed.
